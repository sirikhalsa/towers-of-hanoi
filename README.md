# Towers of Hanoi
## Introduction
Towers of Hanoi is a mathematical game invented in 1883 by a French mathematician, Edouard Lucas. The game consists of 3 vertical rods and some set of discs of various sizes with holes in the middle of the discs, allowing them to be stacked on the rods. The game starts with all of the discs on the leftmost rod with the smallest disc on top and each subsequent size stacked beneath it. The objective of the game is to move all discs such that the discs end up in the same setup on the rightmost rod while following 2 rules:
- Any disc can be moved on to an empty rod.
- Any disc can be moved on to a rod containing a disc such that the disc being moved is smaller than the disc it is being moved on top of.
